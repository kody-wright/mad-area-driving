                On behalf of the staff at Mad Area Driving School, I am happy to welcome you to the 2022-23 school
                year! We are looking forward to a productive partnership with you to ensure our children can
                achieve their highest potential. We recognize that in order to be successful in school, our
                children need support from both the home and school. We know a strong partnership with you
                will make a great difference in your child’s education. As partners, we share the responsibility
                for our children’s success and want you to know that we will do our very best to carry out our
                responsibilities. We ask that you guide and support your child’s learning by ensuring that
                he/she:
              </p>
              <p>I am attaching a copy of our school rules and pickup information so that you and your child can review them together. If
                you have any questions about the rules and expectations, please feel free to contact me or to
                discuss them with your child’s teacher. It is very important that you and your child are fully
                informed regarding standards related to appropriate behavior for a safe and productive school
                year. Please feel free to review the School pickup information and other required information</p>

              <p class="mx-auto">
                <b style="color: purple">East High School</b> pickup will be in
                front of the fieldhouse.
                <b style="color: maroon">Lafollette High School</b> pickup will
                be at the football stadium.
              </p>

              <p class="mx-auto">
                On Saturdays, Sundays, or days when school is not in session,
                unless informed otherwise by Jim of Mad-Area, we will pick your
                teen up and drop them off two hours later at the pickup
                location.
              </p>

              <p class="mx-auto">
                In Wisconsin, students are granted a permit at 15, and a
                probationary license at 16 years of age. At these ages, the
                State feels, students should understand the responsibilities
                associated with the privilege of driving. Therefore, we will
                dismiss any student from our program for repetitive disruptive
                behavior. The first incident of disruptive in class, or in car
                behavior, will be handled by a discussion of the event with
                parents. If a second disruptive behavior incident occurs, the
                student will be dismissed from class without a refund and will
                not be allowed to return for six months. We expect classroom and
                in car instruction to be a good learning environment for all
                students, which is why we must adhere to a strict policy to
                promote this atmosphere.
              </p>

              <p class="mx-auto">
                Each student is teamed with another, therefore if your teen does
                not keep his/her appointment the instructor and your teens
                driving partner will be greatly inconvenienced. To help
                eliminate any unnecessary last minute appointment changes or
                misses, $30.00 will be charged for each missed or unexcused
                appointment. If an appointment is missed the $30.00 fee must be
                paid at the student’s next lesson. Any changes in scheduled
                appointments will not be considered unless made at least 48
                hours in advance to fill the requested appointment change.
              </p>

              <p class="mx-auto">
                For driver education to have a lasting impact, it has to affect
                the behavior and attitude of the novice driver well beyond the
                duration of this course. That can only happen when students,
                parents and instructors combine their efforts and become
                partners to make driving safety a priority. As driver education
                instructors, my staff and I are trained to provide the
                foundation of safe driving. As the driver education parent or
                guardian, you play a key role in guiding your teenager through
                additional practice so he/she will become a good, responsible
                and safe driver.
              </p>

              <p class="mx-auto">
                You are encouraged to call Jim at 345-9598, between
                8:00am-10:00am or 4pm-5:30pm Monday-Friday to schedule driving
                appointments or talk about any concerns relating to your teens
                driving experience.
              </p>
              <p>The wonderful Mad Area driving school staff and I feel privileged to be a part of this school family. We thank
                you for your support and look forward to meeting you.</p>
